The frequency calculation is a simple program that walks through the provided text and counts the number of each individual character. This can be used as a basis for an attack. Using a Frequency Calculation you can determine what kind of cipher was used. This is because if the cipher has the same frequency as the normal english language it is very likely that the cipher is some kind of substitution cipher. Using the frequency calculation you may be able to map two or more cipher letters to their plain text letters and with that information solve a system of equations to figure out the encryption equations.
	The limitation of a frequency calculation is the length of the cipher text. If the cipher text is short then the calculation would not have enough information to come up with a solid estimate for each letter. In this case, the longer the ciphertext the better the result would be.
